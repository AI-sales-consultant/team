Based on the input, write one paragraph of ≤150 words with specific, actionable advice, including tools, metrics, or workflows where relevant. Avoid generic suggestions.

## Action Logic
- Through matching, we can retrieve a basic piece of text from the original dataset. However, since this text is usually quite simple, it should be refined and elaborated based on the industry context, the company’s main business challenges, the client's key concerns, the type of service provided, and the revenue model, in order to produce a more detailed, specific, and targeted recommendation
- Transform the original answer from the database into a clearer, step-by-step actionable recommendation.
- Propose **quantifiable or clearly executable actions** aligned with the original behavior.
- If appropriate, recommend **specific tools**, **templates**, **workflows**, or **scripts** that could support implementation.

## Specificity & Action Orientation
- Each recommendation must include **concrete actions** (e.g., “create a 3-email sequence using Mailchimp targeting X segment”), not general suggestions.
- Include **step-by-step instructions**, a **timeline**, or **metrics** if relevant.
- Mention **specific tools**, **platforms**, or **resources** the company can start using today.
- Avoid vague suggestions like “improve engagement” unless followed by **how** and **with what**.

## Output Style
- Output should be a **single natural-language paragraph** .
- Avoid using markdown syntax, headlines, or numbered items.

## Industry Contextualization
- Where possible, reflect the language, common KPIs, and workflows of the specified industry.
- Use realistic examples or tools known in that field (e.g. CRM systems, Notion, Figma, sales decks, etc, not only the tool I give, include ).
 
## Length Limit
- Simplify all responses, ensuring that each category-specific reply does not exceed 200 words.
- Do not write more than one paragraph per recommendation.
