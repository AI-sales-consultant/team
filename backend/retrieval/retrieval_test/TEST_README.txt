# Data Retrieval Module - Test Suite

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `cosmos_retriever.py` module. The test suite has been implemented using the `pytest` framework to ensure systematic, repeatable, and quantifiable verification of the module's quality.

## 1. Testing Framework

-   **Framework**: `pytest`
-   **Coverage Tool**: `pytest-cov`

This approach was chosen over a custom test runner to leverage industry-standard features for test discovery, fixture management, and reporting. It provides a robust foundation for verifying the module's correctness and resilience.

## 2. Test Suite Structure

The test suite is organized into two primary files, each targeting a distinct aspect of quality assurance:

### `test_comprehensive.py`

-   **Purpose**: To verify the module's functional correctness under normal and boundary conditions.
-   **Key Verifications**:
    -   **Functional Correctness**: Confirms that valid `question_id` and `category` pairs return the expected non-empty string data.
    -   **Invalid Input Handling**: Ensures that non-existent identifiers or empty strings predictably return `None`.
    -   **Data Integrity**: Validates that the returned text contains expected content fragments.
    -   **Boundary Conditions**: Checks that excessively long inputs do not cause exceptions and are handled gracefully.
    -   **Performance Baseline**: Establishes a simple response time benchmark to prevent performance regressions.

### `test_error_handling.py`

-   **Purpose**: To validate the module's resilience and graceful failure mechanisms when faced with external or unexpected errors.
-   **Key Verifications**:
    -   **Dependency Failure**: Simulates a database connection failure by using invalid credentials to confirm that the module's initialization logic handles the error without crashing.
    -   **Type Safety**: Asserts that providing non-string parameters (e.g., `int`, `None`) does not raise an unhandled exception.
    -   **Concurrency Safety**: Simulates multiple concurrent requests using `threading` to verify that the global `CosmosClient` instance is thread-safe.
    -   **Runtime Query Exceptions**: Mocks the database SDK to raise a generic exception during a query, ensuring the module's `try...except` block correctly catches it and returns `None`.

## 3. How to Run Tests and Generate Coverage Report

### 3.1. Prerequisites

Install the required testing libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock
```

Ensure that the `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_KEY` environment variables are correctly configured (e.g., in a `.env` file at the project root).

### 3.2. Execution Command

To run the entire test suite and generate a code coverage report, execute the following command from the **project root directory** (the directory containing `cosmos_retriever.py`):

```bash
pytest --cov=cosmos_retriever --cov-report=term-missing
```

-   `pytest`: Discovers and runs all tests in the `retrieval_test/` directory.
-   `--cov=cosmos_retriever`: Specifies that code coverage should be measured for the `cosmos_retriever.py` module.
-   `--cov-report=term-missing`: Displays a summary report in the terminal, including which lines of code were not executed by the tests.

## 4. Interpreting the Output

A successful test run will show a list of passed tests. The coverage report provides a quantitative measure of test completeness.

**Example Coverage Report:**

```
----------- coverage: platform win32, python 3.10.4 -----------
Name                  Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------
cosmos_retriever.py      25      0   100%
---------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                    25      0   100%
```

A coverage of 100% indicates that every line and branch in the `cosmos_retriever.py` module was executed by the test suite, providing a high degree of confidence in its verified behavior.
